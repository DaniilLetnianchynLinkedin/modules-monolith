Project Startup Guide
Welcome to the project! This guide will show you how to start the project using Docker Compose. You can start the project as a single monolith application or as a series of microservices running in different instances.

Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. If you do not have these installed, please visit Docker's official website for installation instructions.

Starting the Project
Monolithic Deployment
To start the project as a monolith, where all components run in a single container, use the following command:

docker-compose -f ".\docker-compose-monolith.yml" up --build
To start the project with each module running in its own instance (as microservices), use the command below:

docker-compose -f ".\docker-compose-microservices.yml" up --build
